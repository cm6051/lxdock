  <h2>Why use LXDock?</h2>
</div>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
  <p><strong>It's fast.</strong> LXDock is much <em>much</em> faster than a typical Vagrant + Virtualbox setup.</p>
  <p><strong>Multi-arch.</strong> Vagrant has been designed with Virtualbox and x86 in mind. Even if you use alternative providers, youâ€™re going to have to jump through inelegant hoops to have your Vagrantfile work on x86 and arm (for example) at the same time because the very concept of a Vagrant box is arch-specific.</p>
  <p><strong>Simpler.</strong> When working with containers, much of the complexity of Vagrant becomes useless. Why the need for special "vagrant-prepared" boxes when <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lxc exec</span></code> is available? It's much simpler to use whatever images are provided directly by LXD. By removing the need to manage boxes, LXDock suddenly becomes much simpler (a simple wrapper around lxd, really).</p>
